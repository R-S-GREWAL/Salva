    In Salva you will not only get to know about the causes of increasing temperatures but you will also get to know about the ways to conserve our Planet Earth and save it from increasing global warming.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center">Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock.
        
                This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.</p>
                <br><br><h2 style="text-align:center">Global Warming</h2> <br>
                <center><img src="warming2.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"></center> <br>
            <p style="text-align:center">2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature reaching 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2019. Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.
            
            An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious negative impacts on to the natural environment and human health and wellbeing, including a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.
            
            For this reason, the international community has recognised the need to keep warming well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.</p>

        <br><h2 style="text-align: center">10 ways to stop Global Warming :</h2><br>
        <p style="text-align:center">Change a light<br>
            Replacing one regular light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb will save 150 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. 
            <br><br>
            Drive less <br>
            Walk, bike, carpool or take mass transit more often. You'll save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile you don't drive!
            <br><br>
            Recycle more<br>
            You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.
            <br><br>
            Check your tires<br>
            Keeping your tires inflated properly can improve your gas mileage by more than 3 percent. Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
            <br><br>
            Use less hot water<br>
            It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year).
            <br><br>
            Avoid products with a lot of packaging<br>
            You can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent.
            <br><br>
            Adjust your thermostat<br>
            Moving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
            <br><br>
            Plant a tree<br>
            A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.
            <br><br>
            Turn off electronic devices<br>
            Simply turning off your television, DVD player, stereo, and computer, when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year.

    <center><img src="fossil.png" width="400px" height="250px"></center> <br>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Some things that could reduce warming are to burn less fossil fuels, grow more trees, eat less meat, and put some carbon dioxide back in the ground. People could adapt to some temperature change. The Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement try to reduce pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. The easiest task that everyone can do is to plant more and more Trees.</h3>  </p>

            <p style="text-align:center">Heritage, encompasses tangible and intangible, natural and cultural, movable and immovable and documentary assets inherited from the past and transmitted to future generations by virtue of their irreplaceable value. The term ‘heritage’ has evolved considerably over time. Initially referring exclusively to the monumental remains of cultures, the concept of heritage has gradually been expanded to embrace living culture and contemporary expressions.

                As a source of identity, heritage is a valuable factor for empowering local communities and enabling vulnerable groups to participate fully in social and cultural life. It can also provide time-tested solutions for conflict prevention and reconciliation.</p>
        <br><br>
        <center><img src="culture2.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"></center> <br>
        <p style="text-align:center">The deliberate act of keeping cultural heritage from the present for the future is known as preservation (American English) or conservation (British English), which cultural and historical ethnic museums and cultural centers promote, though these terms may have more specific or technical meanings in the same contexts in the other dialect. Preserved heritage has become an anchor of the global tourism industry, a major contributor of economic value to local communities.
            Aspects and disciplines of the preservation and conservation of tangible culture include:
           Museology,
           Archival science,
           Conservation (cultural heritage),
           Art conservation,
           Archaeological conservation,
           Architectural conservation,
           Film preservation,
           Phonograph record preservation,
           Digital preservation. </p><br>

        <br>State languages should be mandatory in Schools.
        <br>There should be cultural activities for students in their schools.
        <br>Government should create Heritage Museums so that people can learn about their History and their culture.
        <br>People should also celebrate cultural events in their societies, villages and their towns so that the younger generations will know about their culture</h3>
